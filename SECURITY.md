### Additional Rules

* Do not attempt to conduct post-exploitation, including modification or destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of GEWIS services
* Do not attempt to perform brute-force attacks, denial-of-service attacks
* Do not compromise or test GEWIS accounts that are not your own. In collaboration, additional accounts for testing purposes can be provided
* If you encounter user information that is not your own in the course of your research, please stop and report this activity using the email address above so we can investigate. Please report to us what information was accessed and delete the data. Do not save, copy, transfer, or otherwise use this data. Continuing to access another personâ€™s data may be regarded as evidence of a lack of good faith

## Reporting Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities can be sent to security@gewis.nl, preferably encrypted with the key that can be found on
https://pgp.surfnet.nl/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x10C778679AEA14D0. 

For all submissions, please include the following (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

* Full description of the vulnerability being reported, including the exploitability and impact
    * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
    * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue
    * (Full) paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
(The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL))

    * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
* If relevant, screenshots or videos
* If relevant, traffic logs
* If relevant, exploit code
